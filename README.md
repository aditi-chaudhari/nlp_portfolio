# nlp_portfolio
A portfolio to showcase what I learned in my NLP course

## NLP Overview
In this [PDF](https://github.com/aditi-chaudhari/nlp_portfolio/blob/main/nlp_overview.pdf), I talk about the historical and current perspectives to NLP and then discuss my own interest in NLP. 

## Text Processing with Python
In this [Python program](https://github.com/aditi-chaudhari/nlp_portfolio/blob/main/text_processing/main.py), I read in metadata from a CSV file, process the text to fit a certain format, and then store it.

In order to run this program, I open Terminal, navigate to my project's directory, and then run the command:

	python main.py data/data.csv

It is important to have the sysarg that specifies the relative path 'data/data.csv'. This tells the program where to read the data from. 

What I found useful about using Python for text processing was that Python seems to have a lot of in-built functions that make text processing easier and more convinient. An example is how simple it is to split strings! 

By completing this assignment, I learned how to input command line arguments into Python programs, use RegEx to validate data, and pickle and unpickle files in Python. I got to review Python File I/O, Python classes, and RegEx rules. 


## Word Guessing Game

In this [Python program](https://github.com/aditi-chaudhari/nlp_portfolio/blob/main/word_guessing_game/main.py), I read in data from a file containing text about anatomy, preprocessed the text to find the 50 most common nouns in the text, and then created a word guessing game that randomly selects a noun from the 50 most common nouns and encourages the user to guess that noun. 

## WordNet
In this [PDF](https://github.com/aditi-chaudhari/nlp_portfolio/blob/main/wordnet/wordnet.pdf), I explore WordNet, SentiWordNet, and collocations.
