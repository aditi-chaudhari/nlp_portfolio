# nlp_portfolio
A portfolio to showcase what I learned in my NLP course

## NLP Overview
In this [PDF](https://github.com/aditi-chaudhari/nlp_portfolio/blob/main/nlp_overview.pdf), I talk about the historical and current perspectives to NLP and then discuss my own interest in NLP. 

## Text Processing with Python
In this [Python program](https://github.com/aditi-chaudhari/nlp_portfolio/blob/main/text_processing/main.py), I read in metadata from a CSV file, process the text to fit a certain format, and then store it.

In order to run this program, I open Terminal, navigate to my project's directory, and then run the command:

	python main.py data/data.csv

It is important to have the sysarg that specifies the relative path 'data/data.csv'. This tells the program where to read the data from. 

What I found useful about using Python for text processing was that Python seems to have a lot of in-built functions that make text processing easier and more convinient. An example is how simple it is to split strings! 

By completing this assignment, I learned how to input command line arguments into Python programs, use RegEx to validate data, and pickle and unpickle files in Python. I got to review Python File I/O, Python classes, and RegEx rules. 


## Word Guessing Game

In this [Python program](https://github.com/aditi-chaudhari/nlp_portfolio/blob/main/word_guessing_game/main.py), I read in data from a file containing text about anatomy, preprocessed the text to find the 50 most common nouns in the text, and then created a word guessing game that randomly selects a noun from the 50 most common nouns and encourages the user to guess that noun. 

## WordNet
In this [PDF](https://github.com/aditi-chaudhari/nlp_portfolio/blob/main/wordnet/wordnet.pdf), I explore WordNet, SentiWordNet, and collocations. 

## Lanuage Classification with N-grams
Using n-grams, I built a probabilistic language model to classify whether certain text is written in English, French, or Italian. The set-up is done in this [program](https://github.com/aditi-chaudhari/nlp_portfolio/blob/main/n_grams/program1.py), and the classification is done in this [program](https://github.com/aditi-chaudhari/nlp_portfolio/blob/main/n_grams/program2.py). I wrote a narrative about n-grams in this [PDF](https://github.com/aditi-chaudhari/nlp_portfolio/blob/main/n_grams/ngrams_narrative.pdf).

## Sentence Parsing
I practiced PSG parsing, dependency parsing, and SRL parsing in this [PDF](https://github.com/aditi-chaudhari/nlp_portfolio/blob/main/sentence_parsing.pdf). 

## Web Crawler 
I built a web crawler in this [Python program](https://github.com/aditi-chaudhari/nlp_portfolio/blob/main/web_crawler/main.py). The documentation for the web crawler can be found in this [PDF](https://github.com/aditi-chaudhari/nlp_portfolio/blob/main/web_crawler/web_crawler_documentation.pdf).

## Text Classification with sklearn
I used sklearn to perform classification using Naive Bayes, logistic regression, and neural networks in this [PDF](https://github.com/aditi-chaudhari/nlp_portfolio/blob/main/text_classification/Text%20Classification%20with%20sklearn.pdf).

## ACL Paper
I read and summarized a paper titled “From the Detection of Toxic Spans in Online Discussion to the
Analysis of Toxic-to-Civil Transfer” in this [PDF](https://github.com/aditi-chaudhari/nlp_portfolio/blob/main/acl_paper.pdf).

## Chatbot
I build a simple chatbot that attempts to predict your zodiac sign and can tell you facts about each zodiac sign in this [Python program](https://github.com/aditi-chaudhari/nlp_portfolio/blob/main/chatbot/chatbot.py). To build the knowledge base, I built a web scraper that scrapes information on each zodiac sign in this [program](https://github.com/aditi-chaudhari/nlp_portfolio/blob/main/chatbot/web_scraper.py). The model used to predict the user's zodiac sign can be found [here](https://github.com/aditi-chaudhari/nlp_portfolio/blob/main/chatbot/sign_classification.py). 

## Text Classification with Deep Learning
In this [PDF](https://github.com/aditi-chaudhari/nlp_portfolio/blob/main/text_classification_DL/text_classification_DL.pdf), I used TensorFlow and Keras for binary text classification. The deep learning models that I built attempt to classify whether someone is depressed or not based off a Reddit post that they made. 

## Wrap-Up

I am thrilled about the possibilities of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and how it can make technology more human and user-friendly. When ChatGPT became popular, I became even more interested in NLP and decided to take the Human Language Technologies course to learn more. Through the course, I gained a plethora of new skills, which I talk about [here](https://github.com/aditi-chaudhari/nlp_portfolio/blob/main/nlp_wrapup.pdf). In the future, I plan to improve my astrology chatbot and make it a fun and engaging app, similar to the astrology app Co-Star. I am always on the lookout for new and emerging NLP technologies that interest me, and I am committed to staying up-to-date with the latest programming techniques. I am enthusiastic about NLP and excited to continue exploring its possibilities.
